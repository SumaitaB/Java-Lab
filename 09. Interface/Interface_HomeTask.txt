Home Task-1
-------------

Write a java application as follows:

Create a Student Interface ‘StInterface’ with the methods ‘setName’, ‘setID’, ‘getName’ and ‘getID’.

Create the class ‘Student’ with ‘name’, ‘id’ and ‘address field’ implementing the ‘StInterface’ to manipulate the Student information using the necessary methods.

Create an array of objects of Student. Then input the number of students to allocate student array dynamically and take Student information. Now print the student list alphabetically.

Home Task-2
------------

Multiple inheritance can be achieved in Java by allowing a class to inherit from one other class and an unlimited number of interfaces.
Complete the following program demonstrating multiple inheritance, which inherits a class and an interface:

interface Engine{
    void setHorsePower(int hrsPwr);
    int getHorsePower();
    void setMaker(String mk);
    String getMaker();
}

class Body{
	private String color;

    void setColor(String clr) {
		color = clr;
	}

    String getColor() {
		return color;
	}
}

Now your task is to:

1. Design a class 'Car' that inherits 'Body' class and implements 'Engine' interface.
   
2. The class 'Car' has two additional data members: one integer variable 'hp' and one String variable 'maker'.
   Create a constructor with arguments in Car class to initialize 'hp', 'maker' and a inherited feature 'color'. 

3. The 'Car' class should provide the body of four abstract methods.

4. Finally, create a Tester class which should contain the main method. Inside the main method 
   create two instances in the following way:

  Car toyota_Corolla = new Car(100, "White", "Toyota");
  Car pajero = new Car(800, "Black", "Mitsubishi");
